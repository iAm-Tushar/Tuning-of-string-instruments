The project is aimed at determining the tuning stage (under-tuned / over-tuned) of any string instrument
like guitar, violin etc. This is a problem that is frequently encountered by both trained musicians
and common people as they need to work with different instruments and even in the case of the same
instrument the tension of the guitar string changes subject to the temperature conditions and other
factors which lead to length expansion or contraction of strings.
